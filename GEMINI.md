# GEMINI.md - Project Context

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the `arl-frontend-vue3` project to be used as instructional context for future interactions.

## Project Overview

This project is a modern frontend for the "ARL Asset Reconnaissance Lighthouse System", a platform for asset reconnaissance and security management. The original project has been refactored using a modern technology stack to improve user experience, maintainability, and performance. The code was initially generated by an AI model.

The application is a single-page application (SPA) that provides a dashboard interface for users to manage security tasks, monitor assets, configure policies, and view various security-related information.

### Key Technologies

- **Frontend Framework:** Vue 3
- **UI Component Library:** Ant Design Vue 4
- **Routing:** Vue Router 4
- **HTTP Client:** Axios
- **Build Tool:** Webpack 5
- **JavaScript Compiler:** Babel
- **CSS Preprocessor:** Less

### Architecture

The project follows a standard Vue.js project structure:

- `src/main.js`: The application entry point where the Vue app is initialized with plugins like the router and Ant Design.
- `src/App.vue`: The root component that defines the main layout, including a collapsible sidebar for navigation and a header.
- `src/router/index.js`: Defines all application routes and handles navigation guards for authentication.
- `src/views/`: Contains the main page components for each route (e.g., `DashboardView.vue`, `LoginView.vue`).
- `src/components/`: Contains reusable UI components (e.g., `PageFooter.vue`).
- `src/api/`: Manages API communication. `http.js` configures an Axios instance with interceptors to inject authentication tokens.
- `src/utils/`: Provides utility functions, notably `auth.js` for handling user authentication tokens and session information.
- `public/`: Stores static assets like `index.html`, logos, and favicons.

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 16.0.0
- npm >= 8.0.0

### Installation

Install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development Server

To run the application in development mode with hot-reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Production Build

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

The bundled files will be generated in the `dist/` directory.

## Development Conventions

- **Component-Based:** The application is built using Vue's single-file components (`.vue` files).
- **Styling:** Styling is done using a combination of Less for pre-processing and scoped CSS within Vue components to avoid style conflicts.
- **API Interaction:** All backend communication is handled through the `axios` instance defined in `src/api/http.js`. This setup includes interceptors for automatically adding the authentication token to requests.
- **Authentication:** The application uses a token-based authentication flow. A JSON Web Token (JWT) is expected from the `/user/login` endpoint. This token is stored in local storage and used for subsequent API calls. The router has a navigation guard in `src/router/index.js` to protect routes that require authentication.
- **Linting:** The `package.json` includes a `lint` script, but it is not currently configured (`echo 'No lint command configured'`).
